# My First README.md
## Cori Buer

I have decided to take this class because I think having a basic understanding of web design is important. I want to start an online store to sell clothes that I make  

But what really is the internet. I was amazed to learn that:

- Andrew Blums ted talk was really interesting. I never pictured the internet as a literal wire connecting the continents.

- The "one second on the web" site blew my mind. I can't believe how many posts are made every second.
