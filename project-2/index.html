With just a few ingredients and simple steps you can turn your bath into a relaxing, floral spa retreat, or an invigorating splash of color and aroma!</p>

  <center><h2>Supplies</h2></center>
  <p>This recipe makes about 12 bathbombs depending on the size of your mold.</p></b>
  <p>Total hands on time is about 15 minutes, <em>but</em> please allow for several hours of drying before settling in for a soak.</p>

  <ul class="table-two">
    <li>8 oz baking soda</li>
    <li>4 oz Epsom salt</li>
    <li>4 oz corn starch</li>
    <li>4 oz citric acid</li>
    <li>Large Bowl</li>
    <li>Whisk</li>
    <li>Biodegradable gliter or dried flower petals (optional)</li>
    <li>2.5 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
    <li>About 1 tablespoon water</li>
    <li> About 2 teaspoons essential oil of your choice (for scent)</li>
    <li>4-6 drops of food coloring</li>
    <li>Small jar or bowl</li>
    <li>12-18 silicone molds</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="instructions">
  <center><h2>Instructions</h2></center>
  <ol>
    <li>First, mix the dry ingredients (baking soda, Epsom salt, corn starch, and citric acid) together in a large bowl. Use the whisk to make sure the mixture is clump-free.</li></br>
    <li>Now mix up the wet ingredients (oil, water, essential oil, and food coloring). The easiest way is to put them in a jar and shake them up. This is the step where you need to decide which scent you would like to use. Different scents have different aromatherapeutic effects. Please refer to this<a href="#table">table</a>to help you decide. Use about two teaspoons of your chosen essential oil or perfume. It's also time to make decisions about color. We recommend sticking to a single hue to avoid muddying the bath waters. Stick to something like 4-6 drops of food coloring total, but feel free to mix up different pigments.</li></br>
    <li><em>Slowly</em> add the liquid to the dry mixture. Really slowly. Like a teaspoon at a time. Whisk as you go, and <strong>slow down</strong> if things start to look fizzy. You should end up with a mixture that just barely clumps together, like damp sand.</li></br>
    <li>Stuff that stuff into your silicone molds, <strong>ASAP.</strong> You don't want the mix to dry out while it's still in the bowl, which is why you should make sure you have enough molds to make a dozen or more bombs at once. Press the mixture down firmly into your silicone molds of choice</li></br>
    <li>Let the bath bombs dry. If your mold has a lot of details in it, you might just want to give them a whole day to be safe. Then pop them out.</li></br>
    <li>Throw one into the tub and enjoy the explosive fruits of your labor. Bag the rest up in cellophane for future use or give them as gifts to your friends and family</li>

<center><h3>Aromatherapy</h3></center>

<center><img src="./images/essentialoils.jpg" alt="different types of essential oils lined up" title="essential oils" width="500" height="225"/></center>


<p>Aromatherapy, also referred to as Essential Oil therapy, can be defined as the art and science of utilizing naturally extracted aromatic essences from plants to balance, harmonize and promote the health of body, mind and spirit. It seeks to unify physiological, psychological and spiritual processes to enhance an individualâ€™s innate healing process. In this project we are going to be utilizing essential oils, so its the perfect opportunity to learn about the benifits of aromatherapy!</p>

<center><h3>Self-care</h3></center>

<blockquote> "To experience peace does not mean that your life is always blissful. It means that you are capable of tapping into a blissful state of mind amidst the normal chaos of a hectic life."</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps my favorite part of this project is how relaxing and stress relieving it can be. Relaxing is a great method of self care and bathbombs are a great relaxtion tool. Every part of this process can be seen as self-care. Creating something yourself (such as this hands-on project) can make you feel empowered and motivated. The process itself can even be a therapuetic one. Add that on to the aromatherapeutic properties of this project and the end reward of a relaxing bath time and you've got yourself a full day of self-care. This project is also a great way to bring people together. Invite your friends over to make bathbombs and then give them out as gifts! This project is fun, easy, and enjoyable!</p>
