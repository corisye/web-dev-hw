# Assignment-3 Readme

##### Head and Body
A document should only have one head and one body element. These elements help organized to the document. The head element contains important information such as the title, author, and publication date. It tells the browser high-level information about the page. The body element is the bulk of the page, it is visible to the audience

##### Structural and Semantic Markup
Strucural markup contains information about the structure of the page. Elements such as headings, lists, breaks. These elements make the page easier to follow and read. The semantic markup is the meaning of the information in the document. This can be used to place emphasis on certain words for example making words *italicized* or **bold** or ~~crossed out~~.

##### Work Cycle
For this work cycle I went through the modules and topics. I skimmed through the book a little. Then I went to start the assignment. I had an issue with linking my image, so I posted it to the forum. Justine responded and told me that I had a space added to the end of my images folder name. So I renamed the folder and it worked just fine. She also told me to not use spaces when naming my folders and I thought that was a very helpful tip.
