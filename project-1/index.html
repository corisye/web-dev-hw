  They were dressed in distressed denim <br />
  legs crossed and notebooks open <br />
  I wished I didn't have to explain <br />
  how difficult the course would be, <br />
  but I soldiered through the syllabus <br />

  thirty-three articles concerning slings, <br />
  forty-nine on arrows, <br />
  countless miserable passages <br />
  they would be obliged to internalize <br />
  to get to, and appreciate, the happy ones.

 To a hand raised in the back <br />
 I explained why joy - post-pubescent joy - <br />
 was reserved for more advanced classes. <br />
